                    In the year 2040, minority demographics in the United States will be the majority. However, the current makeup of the innovation economy does not seem to support this trajectory. Code2040 is a pipeline program that exposes talented Computer Science students of underrepresented backgrounds to the numerous opportunities in this bustling field by way of professional, social, and personal development workshops. In the summer of 2016, I was blessed to be a member of the 5th cohort of the Code2040 Fellows Program. <i>#WeThe5th</i>

However, PTSF is much more than just a financial scholarship. According to the <a href="https://obmny.org/pierre-toussaint-scholars" target="_blank">PTSF site</a>:
