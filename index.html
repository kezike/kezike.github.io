                    <h3><strong>Personal</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        My name is Kayode Ezike, but you can call me Ayo. I was born to two Nigerian Igbo immigrants in the Bronx, NY, where I spent the better part of a decade before moving to New Rochelle, NY in the early 2000s. When I am not designing and implementing complex technical systems, I am likely reading, writing, singing, lifting, or playing basketball. My name means "He Who Brings Joy" and I have done my best to live up to this name everyday by surrounding myself with positivity and sharing it with anyone who will receive it. Among my passions are the protection of identity (digital and organic), empowerment of marginalized groups, and systemic resolution of cultural misunderstanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up, I always admired how my parents were never bashful about the importance of maintaining their identity in an environment that has not always accepted it. This attitude has been perhaps the most valuable asset I have inherited from my parents over the years. From a young age, my three siblings and I have been exposed to Igbo culture in the form of language, cuisine, music, and values. Over the years, I have been fortunate to participate in a strong network of Nigerian communities in the diaspora. These have come primarily in the form of family, friends, and faith-based groups. The unconditional love and support that I have received from my communities have been invaluable for my growth and I have never taken it for granted. For this reason, I have a special pride for my heritage and allegiance to my people. Igbo Kwenu!

                    <h3><strong>Academic</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        At this point, I have been in school for the majority of my life. I have always had a wide diversity of scholastic interests. While I have embraced Math and Science as my primary focus throughout my academic journey, I also love to write and find joy and inspiration in reading creative literature. One day, I will write a book or two to share a broader cross-section of my story than I have done here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout middle school and high school, I took part in various activities that challenged me mentally and exposed me to various fields. Manhattanville College had an amazing summer program, MPALS, for middle school students that afforded participants a rich introduction to advanced topics in Math and Science. Mercy College had a summer program called Mathematical Modeling at Mercy College (M<sup>3</sup>C) that encouraged me to think about Math in a new light. Columbia University had a program called State Pre-College Enrichment Program (S-PREP) that was tailored largely toward the medical sciences. By the time, I was ready for college, I had established a rough set of academic interests that I was curious to explore in depth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the time I made it through the precarious college application process, I found myself at MIT, where I would study Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6-2) in undergrad. I could say a lot about my undergraduate years, but to summarize, tthey were simultaneously the most challenging and enriching 4 years of my life. I expanded my library of mental models, I stretched my vocals in new ways on the stage, and I learned how to lead a community in a demanding environment. Because (and sometimes in spite) of all of this, I met some amazing people that are with me to this day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After undergrad, I went for Round 2: the Master of Engineering (MEng) program. Here, I would specialize in Computer Systems. The MEng experience was not something for which I could have sufficiently prepared. What seemed like a free, simple 1 year program on paper would include countless unaccommodated requests for RA (Research Assistant) positions, one lab switch after the first semester, one expensive unsponsored semester, and many thoughts of uncertainty and doubt on the road to the finish line. However, for all of these trials, I found my stride somewhere along the way. I was blessed to be accepted into the Decentralized Information Group (DIG) within MIT's world-class Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL). Led by the illustrious privacy, security, and systems research scientist, Lalana Kagal, and the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, I was in great company. under their tutelage, I learned a lot about Web technologies of the past and the future and positioned myself to really break grounds in this field. For my thesis, I focused on improving the landscape of digital identity with Web 3.0 technologies. I developed a personal online credentials management tool where users could manage anything from a driving license to an academic diploma. You can read more about it <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/121667" target="_blank">here</a> and play with it <a href="https://github.com/kezike/solid-vc" target="_blank">here</a>. These days, I remain involved in the Web 3.0 and digital identity communities through various Community Groups within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), including the Credentials Community Group (CCG) and the Solid Community Group.

                    <h3><strong>Professional</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Like I said earlier, I have spent the majority of my life in school thus far. Nevertheless, I have had an interesting brush with the corporate world in various ways. Throughout the course of my time at MIT, I utilized the summers to explore technical roles at companies spanning a wide variety of industries. My first internship was in social media as an iOS development role at Facebook as part of a student-focused program called Facebook University (FBU). The second summer introduced me into finance as a technology analyst. In my third inernship, I would be introduced to the micropocessor industry at the namesake of Silicon Valley, Intel. That summer was special beyond the realm of the internship because it introduced me to the Code2040 community through their heralded Fellows Program. Code2040 continues to occupy a fond place in my heart and a separate post may be in order to due it justice.

                        By the time, I had gotten to my senior year, I was itching to experience the startup ecosystem and the world of social impact. In the summer after undergrad, I helped my close friend Ryan to develop his decentralized cloud computing startup called <a href="https://www.conduitcomputing.com/" target="_blank">Conduit</a>. That summer, I had also caught wind of <a href="https://sela-labs.co/" target="_blank">Sela</a>, an impact measurement platform for sustainable development projects in the emerging world. Upon completion of the MEng program in February of 2019, I decided to join Sela full-time as the Director of R&D. In this position, I led the development of various streams of theoretical innovation and empirical prototyping in the realms of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) and Mechanism Design.
